# Git & GitHub for QA Engineers Explained the EASIEST Way!
Here’s a quick breakdown that will make version control feel super simple – with real-life examples just for testers!

## What is Git? 

**Git is a version control system.**
It helps you track changes in your code or files over time.
Think of Git like a "time machine" for your project. If something breaks, you can go back to the previous version and fix it.


### Why do we use Git?
- To save every version of code
- To collaborate with developers or testers
- To work in teams without overwriting each other’s code
  

## What is GitHub?
**GitHub is a website (cloud platform) where your Git projects are stored.**
It’s like Google Drive, but for code.
- You can share code, work together, and even review others' code.

In short:
- Git = Tool to track changes
- GitHub = Online place to store and collaborate using Git

## Why QA Engineers Should Use Git/GitHub
- To maintain automation scripts with version history
- To collaborate with developers
- To run CI/CD pipelines
- To review and track bugs linked to code

## Basic Git Commands for QA
| Command                   | Description                       | Example                                      |

| `git checkout -b <name>`  | Create and switch to new branch   | `git checkout -b feature/test`               |
| `git checkout <name>`     | Switch to another branch          | `git checkout main`                          |
| `git merge <branch>`      | Merge another branch into current | `git merge feature/test`                     |

## Git Example for a QA Test Script
Let’s say you wrote a Selenium test. Here’s how you use Git:
1. Start a Git project
```git init```
2. Connect to GitHub
```git remote add origin <GitHub-url>```
3. Add files
``` git add.```
4. Commit your work
```git commit -m 'First Commit'```
4. Push to GitHub
```git push origin main```

## Tips for QA Engineers
- Use branches to work safely without breaking the main code.
- Always write a clear commit message (what did you change?).
- Pull latest code before pushing.
- Use GitHub to review code changes before merging.
